I am a full-time PhD student admitted in Fall 2021 to the Information Systems and Cyber Security program at the University of Texas at San Antonio. My research focuses on topics in computer vision security, harmful information and misinformation/disinformation on social media. I also am interested in explainable AI and causality in AI.

I currently work as a Graduate Research Assistant under Dr. Paul Rad in the Secure AI and Autonomy Lab.
